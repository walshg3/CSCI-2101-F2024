        // JAVA DATA TYPES
        // int, double, boolean, char, String

        // int -> integer | 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
        // double -> decimal | 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.5
        // boolean -> true or false | yes, no | 1, 0 - "Fork in the road example" (if statements)
        // char -> single character | 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'
        // String -> sequence of characters | "Hello World!", "This is a string"
        // note: char is in single quotes, String is in double quotes

        // JAVA PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
        // PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES are the most basic data types available within the Java language.
        // IE They are built into Java
        // int, double, boolean, char

        // Non-Primitive Data Types
        // Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.
        // String is a non-primitive data type
